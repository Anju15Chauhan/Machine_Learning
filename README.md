**Boston Housing Dataset Project**

In this project, I analyzed the Boston Housing dataset to understand the factors affecting house prices in the Boston area. The dataset included variables such as crime rate, number of rooms, property age, and proximity to employment centers. Using linear regression, I built predictive models to estimate house prices based on these features. The project involved feature engineering, data preprocessing, and model evaluation, resulting in a comprehensive understanding of the housing market dynamics in Boston.

**New York Housing Dataset Project**

In This project focused on the New York Housing dataset, which included detailed information on property prices, types, broker titles, and geographical data. My goal was to analyze and predict housing prices across different boroughs of New York City. I utilized data visualization to identify trends and outliers, and employed machine learning algorithms to build models that could predict house prices based on various factors such as location, size, and amenities. This project highlighted my skills in handling large datasets, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and deploying predictive models.

#**Telco Customer Churn Dataset**

This dataset contains information about a telecommunications company's customers and whether they have churned (i.e., stopped using the service) or not. The data can be used to predict customer churn based on demographic, account, and service details.

Dataset Overview
The dataset includes 21 columns with various features related to the customers, their subscriptions, and their usage patterns:

**customerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.

**gender**: Gender of the customer (Male, Female).

**SeniorCitizen**: Indicates if the customer is a senior citizen (1 for Yes, 0 for No).

**Partner**: Indicates if the customer has a partner (Yes, No).

**Dependents**: Indicates if the customer has dependents (Yes, No).

**tenure**: Number of months the customer has been with the company.

**PhoneService**: Indicates if the customer has a phone service (Yes, No).

**MultipleLines**: Indicates if the customer has multiple lines (No, Yes, No phone service).

**InternetService**: Type of internet service (DSL, Fiber optic, No).

**OnlineSecurity**: Indicates if the customer has online security (Yes, No).

**OnlineBackup**: Indicates if the customer has online backup (Yes, No).

**DeviceProtection**: Indicates if the customer has device protection (Yes, No).

**TechSupport**: Indicates if the customer has tech support (Yes, No).

**StreamingTV**: Indicates if the customer has streaming TV (Yes, No).

**StreamingMovies**: Indicates if the customer has streaming movies (Yes, No).

**Contract**: Type of contract (Month-to-month, One year, Two year).

**PaperlessBilling**: Indicates if the customer has paperless billing (Yes, No).

**PaymentMethod**: Payment method (Electronic check, Mailed check, Bank transfer (automatic), Credit card (automatic)).

**MonthlyCharges**: Monthly charges for the customer.

**TotalCharges**: Total charges for the customer.

**Churn**: Indicates if the customer has churned (Yes, No).

Use Cases
This dataset is commonly used for:
* Predicting customer churn.
* Analyzing customer behavior and subscription patterns.
* Understanding the impact of service offerings on customer retention.
