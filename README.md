1. Boston Housing Dataset Project
2. In this project, I analyzed the Boston Housing dataset to understand the factors affecting house prices in the Boston area. The dataset included variables such as crime rate, number of rooms, property age, and proximity to employment centers. Using linear regression, I built predictive models to estimate house prices based on these features. The project involved feature engineering, data preprocessing, and model evaluation, resulting in a comprehensive understanding of the housing market dynamics in Boston.

5.   New York Housing Dataset Project
6. In This project focused on the New York Housing dataset, which included detailed information on property prices, types, broker titles, and geographical data. My goal was to analyze and predict housing prices across different boroughs of New York City. I utilized data visualization to identify trends and outliers, and employed machine learning algorithms to build models that could predict house prices based on various factors such as location, size, and amenities. This project highlighted my skills in handling large datasets, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and deploying predictive models.
